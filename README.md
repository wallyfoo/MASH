# MASH

This is my implementation of a classic back-of-the-notebook classroom time-waster.

It's written in Vue3 + Typescript. Tooling by Vite.

NGL: I probably spent more time juicing up the UI than I needed to, but it was a fun exercise and a compelling challenge.

`npm run dev` for the version with sound, so make sure you have your volume on.

I've tested it in Firefox, Chrome, and Safari on the latest MacOS. Didn't test it on mobile at all.

Thanks for the opportunity to take a swing at this project. I look forward to hearing from you.
